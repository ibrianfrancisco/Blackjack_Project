#BlackJack

----
###Description
First project at General Assembly. Implemented the basic structure of the game.

###Technologies Used

- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScipt
- jQuery

###Getting Started
- Link to [game](https://ibrianfrancisco.github.io/Blackjack_Project/)

Clicking on this link will take you to the BlackJack title screen. From there you have two options to choose from. If you are a beginner, you can read about How To Play. If you already know the rules, go straight into playing by clicking Let's Play.

On the game page, you must start off by betting a number of chips to gamble. Simply click on the chip amount to add it to your bet total. Once ready, click "Deal" to deal out the cards. From there, you can either click "Hit" or "Stand". If you didn't bust, you'll then compare your total score with the dealer's score and a message will notify if you won or lost.

###Next Steps
Things to implement in the future:

  - Double down button
  - Split button
  - Insurance button
  - User friendly buttons 
  - Set a High Score Rank
