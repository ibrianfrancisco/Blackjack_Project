###How to play
The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21. You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards. The cards 2 through 10 have their face value, J, Q, and K are worth 10 points each, and the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (player's choice).  
  
At the start of the game, the player and dealer receive two cards each. The player's cards are face up while the dealer has one face down. If the player starts with a total score of 21, this is called a blackjack and they automatically win unless the dealer also has a blackjack.
  
Then the player can keep their hand as it is (stand) or take more cards from the deck (hit), one at a time, until either the player judges that the hand is strong enough to go up against the dealer's hand and stands, or until it goes over 21, in which case the player immediately loses (busts).
