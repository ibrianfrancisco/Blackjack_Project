#The name of the game is BlackJack

----
###How to play
The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21. You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards. The cards 2 through 10 have their face value, J, Q, and K are worth 10 points each, and the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (player's choice).  
  
At the start of the game, the player and dealer receive two cards each. The player's cards are face up while the dealer has one face down. If the player starts with a total score of 21, this is called a blackjack and they automatically win unless the dealer also has a blackjack.
  
Then the player can keep their hand as it is (stand) or take more cards from the deck (hit), one at a time, until either the player judges that the hand is strong enough to go up against the dealer's hand and stands, or until it goes over 21, in which case the player immediately loses (busts).

###Getting Started
**Link to game:** https://ibrianfrancisco.github.io/Blackjack_Project/  
Clicking on this link will take you to the BlackJack title screen. From there you have two options to choose from. If you are a beginner, you can read about How To Play. If you already know the rules, go straight into playing by clicking Let's Play.

On the game page, you must start off by betting a number of chips to gamble. Simply click on the chip amount to add it to your bet total. Once ready, click "Deal" to deal out the cards. From there, you can either click "Hit" or "Stand". If you didn't bust, you'll then compare your total score with the dealer's score and a message will notify if you won or lost.

###Next Steps
Things to implement in the future:

  2. Double down button - allows the player to double their bet after seeing their initial two cards. The catch is you can only Hit once.
  3. Split button - when a player is dealt two of the same card, you can split them into two new hands. You are then dealt two more cards and your bet is doubled. You then play each hand normally which gives you more chances to beat the dealer.
  4. Insurance button - if the dealers face-up card is an ace, the player is allowed to take insurance which counts as a side bet treated independantly from the main wager.
  5. User friendly buttons - will allow the player to continue playing cards with minimal button pressing. 
  6. Set a High Score Rank - will let the player know the max amount of money had in total in their time playing.
