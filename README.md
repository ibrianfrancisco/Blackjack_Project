#BlackJack

----
###Description
First project at General Assembly. Implemented the basic structure of the game.

###Technologies Used

- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScipt
- jQuery

###Getting Started
- Link to [game](https://ibrianfrancisco.github.io/Blackjack_Project/)

On the game page, you must start off by betting a number of chips to gamble. Simply click on the chip amount to add it to your bet total. Once ready, click "Deal" to deal out the cards. From there, you can either click "Hit" or "Stand". If you didn't bust, you'll then compare your total score with the dealer's score and a message will notify if you won or lost. After that click reset to play again!

If you run out of funds, just click reset to start back at 500. See how far you can go!

###Next Steps
Things to implement in the future:

  - Double down button
  - Split button
  - Insurance button
  - Set a High Score Rank
